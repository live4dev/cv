# Welcome letter
Hi, my name is Danil. I'm a developer, team lead, husband, father and organizer of the python community in St. Petersburg. In my work, I try to be a player-coach. I believe that the most important and useful for business solutions are at the junction of different domains.

For the last 7 years, I have been working as a researcher-developer in satellite oceanography, a full stack web developer, a senior web developer, and a web development team lead.

I work as a Lead of cross-functional team. With the team, we are developong features for high-end users in [World Of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com). I'm responsible for the development, delivery of quality features on time, the search for new technical solutions to reduce development time, the interviewing of new employees and the team building.

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

I'm developing several OpenSource useful projects:

* [aiohug](https://github.com/nonamenix/aiohug) ([read more](https://github.com/nonamenix/notes/blob/master/notes/20190309_aiohug.md))
* [marshmallow-jam](https://github.com/nonamenix/marshmallow-jam)
* [aioviber](https://github.com/nonamenix/aioviber)
* [sentry2prometheus](https://github.com/nonamenix/sentry2prometheus)

and a bit more on [Github](https://github.com/nonamenix/).
